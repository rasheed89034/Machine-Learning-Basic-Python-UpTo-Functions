## Python Fundamentals Mastery
## I've developed strong foundational skills in Python programming, including:

## Core Concepts
## Variables: Understanding of variable declaration, dynamic typing, naming conventions, and scope (local vs global)

## Operators: Proficiency with arithmetic, comparison, logical, assignment, identity (is, is not), and membership (in, not in) operators

## Control Structures
## Conditional Statements: if, elif, else with proper indentation and nesting

## Loops:
## for loops with range(), iterating through sequences
## while loops with break/continue/pass statements
## Loop control with else clauses

## Data Structures
## Lists: Creation, indexing/slicing, methods (append(), extend(), insert(), remove(), pop(), etc.), list comprehensions
## Tuples: Immutable sequences, packing/unpacking, use cases where immutability is preferred
## Dictionaries: Key-value pairs, methods (keys(), values(), items()), dictionary comprehensions

## Functions
## Function definition with def
## Parameters and arguments (positional, keyword, default)
## Return values and multiple returns (as tuples)
## Lambda functions for anonymous, inline operations
## filter() function for functional programming approaches
## Variable scope (global vs local) and the global keyword
